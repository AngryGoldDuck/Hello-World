# Hello-World
My first repository

Hi, I am Angrygoat..whatever. Newbie on programming but I have to try.
Back to my first passion in programming when I watched the spy movies.
I don't know what to do if I decide to jump into this area. How can I use this skill to make money?
I always ask myself because This is not my area. I graduated from aviation school I don't know about programming.
Finally, My first programming language is Pyhton becuase Python can do almost everything and every field. So, move on!
